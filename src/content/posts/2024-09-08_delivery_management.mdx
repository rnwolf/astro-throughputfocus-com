need to answer When questions. They need to get things done and have to balance goals and budgets.

Maintain your developers’ trust. Apply iterative buffer planning to make sure long-term plans are sustainable. Keep that first roadmap unambitious. Let the team feel ahead of schedule and increase the rhythm from there. Developers rightfully fear the roadmap is going to contain promises at their expense.

Roadmaps are so despised because they are shown in backrooms where managers engage in wishful thinking. It’s tradition to make compromises without involving the devs. Centralize that roadmap in a place where it's accessible to all and make it a habit of discussing it regularly. Every team member and stakeholder should know the roadmap by heart.

 least productive ones have something in common: management has fabricated a roadmap detached from their teams' realities.


feedback-and-adapt cycles, is pointless in a fixed-price project where the scope is defined upfront.

Life cycle and organisaitonal size.

start-up can do is apply a rigid framework with fixed milestones. To capture the magic of the start-up rock'n roll, the team needs to optimize for flexibility while ensuring they still get things done.

These teams lack resources and capacity, but they have a communication bonus: there are never too many cooks in the kitchen. Decisions are fast, and teams are easy to align

Start-ups need to leverage that superpower by working in short, focused bursts. Rather than thinking in multiple parallel projects, they need to think in sequential blocks of solving one problem at a time.


Scale-ups want to hold on to the start-up communication superpower but need to add more structure. The worst they can do is stick to a single large team. Find products or logical components and build small teams around those. When done well, a single product manager can drive the vision.

Long-term planning in scale-ups is still rather straightforward, but inter-team alignment through a centralized roadmap becomes crucial.

Tools to apply: centralized roadmaps, small dedicated product teams, a single product manager
